- Follow "if-then" rules
- Example: Thermostat, basic chatbots

#### 2. Model-Based Agents
- Maintain internal state/memory
- Track how the world changes
- Example: Navigation systems

#### 3. Goal-Based Agents
- Work toward specific objectives
- Plan sequences of actions
- Example: Game-playing AI, route planners

#### 4. Utility-Based Agents
- Optimize for best outcomes
- Weigh different goals and preferences
- Example: Recommendation systems

#### 5. Learning Agents
- Improve through experience
- Adapt to new situations
